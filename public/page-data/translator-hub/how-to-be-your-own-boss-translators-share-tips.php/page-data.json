An acquaintance finds out what you do for a living and squeals, &ldquo;You work for yourself? Lucky!&rdquo; &ndash; And you wince.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freelances know that the most attractive aspect of their profession coincides with the most daunting:&nbsp;being your own manager. Freelancing turns the translator into a corporation. From one minute to the next, you have to change into customer service, secretarial, accounting, and marketing hats &ndash; while getting paid only for translation!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a forum about the pressures of freelance translation, ProZ participants suggested some good management ideas to minimize frustrations and maximize efficiency in The Individual Freelancer Corp. (the smallest SMB there is):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Set reasonable boundaries.&nbsp;</strong>Turn off your phone, limit your business hours, don&rsquo;t blindly accept last-minute jobs. Appearing constantly available might please clients momentarily, but it will drive you crazy later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/a-healthy-translator-in-a-healthy-body-hub.php\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Take care of yourself. </strong></a>Plan vacations &ndash; for your own sake and your clients&rsquo;. Take some time for lunch every day and a getaway for a long weekend every once in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subcontract reliable colleagues.</strong> Having a trustworthy backup to help share sudden workloads or cover in emergencies will pay off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/freelance-outsourcing-can-simplify-your-life.php\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Outsource </strong></a>your customer service, secretarial, and accounting roles. Spouses, parents, and retired friends are good candidates for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remember that your services are valuable.</strong> Good clients won&rsquo;t drop you for failing to be a 24/7 translation machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomedes.com/translator-hub/three-ted-talks-to-help-you-work-smarter.php\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Work smarter, not harder. </strong></a>Develop your strengths and specialties to gain a competitive edge. If you find yourself more in demand than you can handle, instead of taking on more work, increase your rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protect your love of translating.</strong> Don&rsquo;t burn yourself out and risk forgetting why you got into the industry in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to evaluate your boss. <strong>How are you managing yourself well and what could you do better?</strong> Give this some serious thought. After all, your sole employee&rsquo;s productivity, health and happiness rest on how you answer!</p>\r\n","slug":"/translator-hub/how-to-be-your-own-boss-translators-share-tips.php"}}}},
