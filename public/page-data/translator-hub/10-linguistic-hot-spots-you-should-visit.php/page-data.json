If that describes you, here are suggestions for your next vacation locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Rosetta Stone &ndash; British Museum in London</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ancient Rosetta Stone&rsquo;s three-language inscription unlocked the 1400-year-old secret of hieroglyphics in one of the most significant feats of translation ever performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Gutenberg Museum &ndash; Mainz, Germany</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The century-old printing museum honors not only the founder of the legendary press, but features equipment and materials from across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Small World&rdquo; &ndash; any Disneyland&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Featuring possibly the most translated song ever written, the slow watery ride takes visitors through the world in miniature, inhabited by 300 audio-animatronic dolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. &nbsp;National Museum of Language &ndash; College Park, MD</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed &ldquo;to inspire an appreciation for the magic and beauty of language,&rdquo; this volunteer-run museum focuses on language diversity in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.

The Pillars of Ashoka &ndash; various locations including Delhi and Allahabad</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These forty-foot, fifty-ton pillars from the 3rd century BCE were inscribed with edicts in the Brahmi script.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Georgia Guidestones &ndash; Elbert County, Georgia, USA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On a lighter, less ancient note, this quirky granite monument is inscribed in eight modern languages as well as Babyslonian, Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian hieroglyphs and has been nicknamed the &ldquo;American Stonehenge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Shiloah (Siloam) inscription - City of David, Jerusalem, Israel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Found within Hezekiah&rsquo;s Tunnel, the Shiloah inscription was for many years considered the oldest Hebrew inscription until a surprise discovery in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Ikom Monoliths &ndash; Cross River State, Nigeria&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These volcanic-stone monoliths of unknown age feature faces and patterns as well as inscriptions in Nsibidi, a West Central African script possibly 7,000 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. &ldquo;Golden Dreams of Gandhiji&rdquo; by Dr. Kesiraju Srinivas &ndash; Internet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our final destination is not a place at all.
