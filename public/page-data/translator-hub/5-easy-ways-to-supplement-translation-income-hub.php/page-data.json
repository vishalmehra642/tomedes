Here are five popular side jobs of freelance translators to get you thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Writing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From articles to blog posts to eBooks, freelance translators often supplement their income by taking on paid writing positions through sites such as <a href=\"https://www.odesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">oDesk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elance.com/\" target=\"_blank\">eLance</a> &ndash; often in more than one language. After all, if you have the vocabulary and a flair for linguistics, writing is a natural extension of what you already do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Online marketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay-per-task online marketing work, through sites such as <a href=\"http://www.cloudcrowd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CloudCrowd</a>, is a quick and easy way to earn additional cash without committing to long-term contracts. You can develop product descriptions and marketing text while translation work is slow, then drop it with no guilt whatsoever once the translation side of things picks up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bar/shop work</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Part-time bar or shop work is a surprisingly popular source of second income for freelance translators. Although not usually highly paid, the work has a social element to it, which freelancers often miss out on. It&rsquo;s also a nice way to relax the mind &ndash; while still earning a bit of extra money &ndash; after the more mentally taxing task of translation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Language tuition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You already know two (or more) languages, so why not profit from your hard-earned knowledge by providing private language tuition? From youngsters needing extra help at school, to older adults simply looking to keep their minds active and learn a new skill, the market is thriving. Embrace modern technology and offer online classes over Skype and you have a global audience for tuition at your fingertips. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be creative</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From making jewellery to busking, developing your creative skills is a popular and enjoyable side job of many freelance translators. You can play to your strengths and make some extra money while allowing those creative juices to flow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a little imagination and by making the most of the skills you already have, supplementing your translation income can be quick and easy. Identify your own particular talents and consider how you can put them to good use in order to boost your income streams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you already doing a side job &ndash; either one mentioned above or something else?
