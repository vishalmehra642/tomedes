Every translator has probably used at least one of these during their time on Twitter and many will regularly use a combination of all four.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining these hashtags with others can provide excellent results. For example #translation #jobs can be used to identify potential work opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The abbreviations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The increased usage of text speak (regardless of your views on it) has massively infiltrated the world of Twitter, in large part due to the 140 character limit. This has given rise to several abbreviated hashtags for the translation industry. Two of the most popular ones include: <strong>#xl8</strong> and<strong> #t9n</strong>. The former is an abbreviated version of the word &lsquo;translate,&rsquo; while the latter is for &lsquo;translation.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variations on these two main hashtags are also frequently used, such as <strong>#medxl8</strong> for medical translation. &nbsp;Another popular abbreviation is <strong>#L10n</strong>, which is the abbreviated hashtag for &lsquo;localization&rsquo; (though #localization is also commonly used).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Industry events</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The translation industry sees many events held each year, including conferences, seminars, networking days and web sessions. These can be identified through the general <strong>#xl8events</strong> hashtag, as well as other hashtags for more specific events, such as #daa11eu for the EU Digital Agenda Assembly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keeping it simple</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For those looking to keep their hashtag life simple,<strong> #xl8 is probably the one to stick with</strong>. This will allow you to connect widely and to keep up with news and events across the industry, as well as monitoring the latest developments and trends.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which translation hashtags do you use most often on Twitter?
